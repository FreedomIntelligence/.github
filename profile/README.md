## Welcome to FreedomAI! ðŸ‘‹

We are a research team from ![Homepage logo](./cuhksz-logo.png) *The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen*, dedicated to cutting-edge research in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We develop model architectures, open-source datasets, and share our research outcomes with the community to foster continued progress and in-depth research in the field ðŸš€. 

Our research interests are broad and include:

- `Democratizing` Large Language Models (LLMs);
- Advancing `Medical`, `Mathematical`, `Reasoning`, and `Multilingual` capabilities of LLMs;
- Developing `Unified Multimodal Models` for both understanding and generation;
- Exploring `Agents`, `Tool Use`, `HCI`, `MCP`, and `RAG` in LLMs;
- `Evaluating` and deepening the understanding of LLMs;
- Investigating core applications in NLP and `Speech`;
- LLM Applications in other fields.
